  <p class="text-base mb-4">Posted on 9. July 2025</p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    This is the privacy policy for the QRocket app. It describes which data the app accesses, collects, uses and shares. It also explains how we secure user data, how long it is retained and when it is deleted.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
    This privacy policy is valid as of now. Adjustments to our app functionality or changing legal/regulatory environments might necessitate future adjustments to this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Responsible Party</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
    The app is offered in the app stores by SURESH.app who can be contacted at this e-mail address: <a href="mailto:hello@suresh.app" class="text-blue-600 underline">hello@suresh.app</a>
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    When an error occurs in the app, data is transferred to the app developer. This crash report doesn't contain your personal information, merely diagnostic information such as your device model and the action that led to the error. You can opt out of crash reporting in the app settings. Crash data is used to ensure a problem-free app experience. It is automatically deleted after 90 days.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
    The app also allows accessing other third party websites through clicking links. We have no control over the content of third party sites and therefore can't assume responsibility for it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Your Rights as an Affected Person</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the right to request information at any time about whether and which of your data we process and for what purpose, and to whom and on what basis it is disclosed (Art. 15 GDPR). This also includes your right to receive copies. In the case of a large amount of data, you may be asked to specify the information to certain types of data. The information must be provided without delay and may in no case take longer than one month.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the right to have inaccurately collected personal data corrected or incompletely collected data completed (Art. 16 GDPR).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your data, provided that the legal requirements for this are met (Art. 18 GDPR).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the 'right to be forgotten', meaning you can demand that we delete your personal data, provided that the legal requirements for this are met (Art. 17 GDPR). Irrespective of this, your personal data will be automatically deleted by us if the purpose of the data collection has ceased to exist or the data processing has been carried out unlawfully.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you in a structured, common, and machine-readable format or to request the transfer to another controller (Art. 20 GDPR).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    According to Art. 7 (3) GDPR, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time. This means we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent for the future.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time, provided that a right of objection is provided for by law. In the event of an effective objection, your personal data will also be automatically deleted by us (Art. 21 GDPR).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    You can request the deletion of your account by sending us an e-mail.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
    Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy pursuant to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement, if you believe the processing of personal data concerning you infringes GDPR. The competent supervisory authority for us is, among others, the state commissioner for data protection.
